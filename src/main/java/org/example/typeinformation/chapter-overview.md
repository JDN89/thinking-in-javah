    ## Overview

- The Need for RTTI: The chapter begins by discussing why RTTI is needed. It explains that since Java is a strongly
  typed language, it has extensive compile-time type checking. However, there are situations where you need to
  understand and use type information during the runtime of the program, and this is where RTTI comes in.

- The Basic RTTI Mechanisms: This section talks about the basic RTTI mechanisms in Java, such as using instanceof to
  determine the type of an object and casting.

- The Class Object: In this part, the chapter covers the Class object in depth. It explains that for every type of
  object, there is a Class object that holds information about that type. This section talks about how to get
  references to Class objects, including using class literals like ClassName.class and the getClass() method.

- Class Literals: This topic delves into class literals which are expressions that create references to Class
  objects. Itâ€™s represented as TypeName.class. This is used to pass type information around without the overhead of
  creating individual objects.

- Generic Class References: This section extends the concept of Class references to Generics. It shows how to
  maintain the type information in a more specific way using generics, e.g., Class<String>.

- Runtime Class Information: Here, the chapter goes into more detail on how you can obtain information about a class
  at runtime using the methods provided by the Class object. It shows how to find the superclass, implemented
  interfaces, constructors, methods, fields, etc.

- Dynamic Proxies: This topic covers dynamic proxies in Java, which allow you to create a dynamic implementation of
  a set of interfaces at runtime. This is a powerful feature, especially in scenarios like event listeners, proxy
  patterns, etc.

- Null Objects: Towards the end, the chapter discusses the Null Object pattern as a design choice to provide an
  object as a surrogate for the lack of an object of a given type. It showcases how to employ this pattern to reduce
  the need for checking null.

- Interfaces and Type Information: This section covers how interfaces can be used to abstract the concept of type
  and how RTTI can be applied to interfaces.

- The Registered Factories Method: In this section, the author explains the factory method pattern. This is
  particularly useful in cases where the class of objects you want to create is determined at runtime.

- The instanceof Keyword: The chapter discusses using instanceof for type comparisons and how it can be employed in
  program control flow.
